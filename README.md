Introduction to BFSI Case Study:

The Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector deals with managing financial transactions, providing banking services, and offering insurance products to individuals and businesses. In this case study, we aim to develop a predictive model to assess credit risk for loan applicants, a critical task in the BFSI domain.

Objective:

The primary objective of this case study is to predict the likelihood of loan default or credit default based on various features collected from loan applicants. By accurately predicting credit risk, financial institutions can make informed decisions when approving or rejecting loan applications, thereby minimizing potential losses and maintaining a healthy loan portfolio.

Implementation in Python:

We implement the BFSI case study using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn.

The implementation involves several key steps:

The code starts by mounting Google Drive and then loading two CSV files, applications_base.csv and bureau.csv, into Pandas DataFrames (applications and bureau).
It checks for missing values in both datasets and displays the count of missing values.

The code performs the following tasks:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loads CSV files into Pandas DataFrames, checks for missing values, and displays counts.

Handling Missing Values: Fills missing values with zeroes.

Feature Engineering: Aggregates bureau data by SK_ID_CURR and merges it with applications data.

Removing Columns with High Missing Value Percentage: Drops columns with missing values exceeding a threshold.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Scaling: Imputes missing values, splits data into features and target, scales numeric features.

Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE: Uses SMOTE to address class imbalance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes target variable distribution and explores correlations and specific relationships.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trains Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers, evaluates on test set, and displays results.

Feature Importance Analysis: Although not explicitly shown, feature importance analysis could be performed to understand variable importance.

In conclusion, the code presents a comprehensive pipeline for BFSI analysis, covering data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
